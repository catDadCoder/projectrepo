  This is my first webpage using html. Learning programming is fun but I can't
  wait to get to the juicy stuff!
</p>
<ul>
  Some of my expectations from this course are as follows:
  <li>
    Learn javaScript, Python and other programming tools useful in front- and
    back- end web development
  </li>
  <li>
    Connect with my fellow students and build a network to help me get started
    on the field
  </li>
  <li>
    Create my first major project employing the skills I learned in the program
  </li>
</ul>
